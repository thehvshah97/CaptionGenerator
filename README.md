# ImageCaptioning
An Image Captioning Model developed on the Flickr8K dataset using the pretrained weights of the VGGNet16, we developed an LSTM to generate a sentence level description of the Image. Extended for use by adding a component to extract Hashtags and Quotes based on the context of the Image using Web Scraping.
